    "text": "Creating a SONA account\nIf you have never used Sona before, you must go to http://rit.sona-systems.com and create an account. If you used SONA through RIT previously, use the password recovery feature to reactivate your account. Do not create a new one.\nPut in your correct first and last name.\nPut in your RIT email address, the portion before the @ sign, as your User ID. So, if your RIT email is abc1234@rit.edu, your User ID would be abc1234. Even if you have set up an alternate email account or you redirect your email to another address, your User ID should be based on your original RIT email address, in the format abc1234.\nSelect only the class or classes you are enrolled in. Check to make sure you have the right section - look at the section number (i.e., PSYC 101-04), the 5-digit course code, and when/how the class meets. If you enroll yourself in the wrong class, you might not get credits that you have earned. Do NOT enroll yourself in every class or in any class that you aren't in.\nYou will receive an email with a temporary password. Login again with your temporary password and change it to something else. \nOnce you create an account, you’ll be asked to acknolwedge the human subjects policy. Then, you will be directed to complete a 5-question prescreen that asks about your age, vision, and hearing. Be sure to provide accurate information. If you tell the prescreen that you are under 18 when you are 18+ or vice versa, you will lose all of your credits and be prohibited from earning more credits for the rest of the semester.\nTo sign up for studies, click on Studies or View Available Studies. This shows you all the studies currently registered in the system. If the leftmost column says Timeslots Available, they are currently accepting new participants.\nCheck the eligibility criteria on the rightmost column. Studies that do not match your screening criteria will be omitted, but there are other eligibility criteria not included in the screening, so be sure to check. If you’re eligible, click on the study to sign up. You can do online studies immediately. For face-to-face studies, you’ll be prompted to schedule a time to come into the lab (usually in Eastman). Under Study Information, the Credits line will tell you how many credits you can earn by completing the full study.\nStudies begin with a consent form. Read it carefully and decide whether to consent. Research alternatives begin with a disclosure of what is involved in the task, but do not require you to officially consent.\nBe honest. Do not lie about your personal characteristics to pretend you are eligible for a study or provide false information when completing a questionnaire. Study data is being used for real research and inaccurate responses hold back science. If you’re asked a question you feel uncomfortable providing a truthful answer to, in some cases you can skip that question, and in all cases, you are free to quit the study.\nPay attention! You can lose your credits if you responded randomly or without effort. If your responses show you were not reading and thinking, the researchers can take away automatic credit when they review your data. Studies will notify you if you have been denied credit for failing attention checks. If this happens to you, find a new study and pay closer attention.\nYou can quit any study or research alternative at any time. You usually will not receive partial credit for the time you spent on the study. If partial credit is available, that will be explained in that study’s consent.\nResearch and research alternatives have a debriefing form at the end which explains the purpose of the study. This gives you a chance to learn more about research and to ask any questions.\nMake sure you go all the way to the end of the study. The last page, for example, might ask you to click a link or button to finish up. This is necessary to assign you credit.\nRead any post-study instructions carefully. For example, some allow you to choose between entering a raffle and getting SONA credit. For online studies, make sure you click through to the end of the study to ensure credit.\nMost online studies assign credit automatically in which case you should receive credit within a few minutes. Some online studies assign credit manually, as do all face-to-face studies. In this case, it can take up to 1 week for your credit to be posted. If you haven’t been credited by that time, contact the researcher. You don’t need to notify your professor about your credits. They will be handled automatically.\nMany studies don’t begin until about 3-4 weeks into the semester, so don’t worry if there aren’t many available right away. Studies are added and removed throughout the semester, so check back often. If you want to do real studies for your research requirement, don’t wait until the last minute! Many studies close or fill up before the end of the semester.\nDon’t worry if you’re not eligible for some of the posted studies. There will be enough studies and research alternatives available to meet your class requirements.\nMost research alternatives are not made available until the last 2 weeks of the semester, but some may be posted earlier; check back occasionally to see what’s available. You can identify research alternatives because they have the words Research Alternative in the title and the description. Sufficient research alternatives will be made available to ensure that students who are ineligible for or choose not to participate in real research will be able to earn all required credits."
