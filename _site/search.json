    "text": "Creating a SONA account\nIf you have never used Sona before, you must go to http://rit.sona-systems.com and create an account. If you used SONA through RIT previously, use the password recovery feature to reactivate your account. Do not create a new one.\nPut in your correct first and last name.\nPut in your RIT email address, the portion before the @ sign, as your User ID. So, if your RIT email is abc1234@rit.edu, your User ID would be abc1234. Even if you have set up an alternate email account or you redirect your email to another address, your User ID should be based on your original RIT email address, in the format abc1234.\nSelect only the class or classes you are enrolled in. Check to make sure you have the right section - look at the section number (i.e., PSYC 101-04), the 5-digit course code, and when/how the class meets. If you enroll yourself in the wrong class, you might not get credits that you have earned. Do NOT enroll yourself in every class or in any class that you aren’t in.\nYou will receive an email with a temporary password. Login again with your temporary password and change it to something else.\nOnce you create an account, you’ll be asked to acknowledge the human subjects policy. Then, you will be directed to complete a 5-question prescreen that asks about your age, vision, and hearing. Be sure to provide accurate information. If you tell the prescreen that you are under 18 when you are 18+ or vice versa, you will lose all of your credits and be prohibited from earning more credits for the rest of the semester.\n\n\nSigning up for Studies\nTo sign up for studies, click on Studies or View Available Studies. This shows you all the studies currently registered in the system. If the leftmost column says Timeslots Available, they are currently accepting new participants.\nCheck the eligibility criteria on the rightmost column. Studies that do not match your screening criteria will be omitted, but there are other eligibility criteria not included in the screening, so be sure to check. If you’re eligible, click on the study to sign up. You can do online studies immediately. For face-to-face studies, you’ll be prompted to schedule a time to come into the lab (usually in Eastman). Under Study Information, the Credits line will tell you how many credits you can earn by completing the full study.\nStudies begin with a consent form. Read it carefully and decide whether to consent. Research alternatives begin with a disclosure of what is involved in the task, but do not require you to officially consent.\nBe honest. Do not lie about your personal characteristics to pretend you are eligible for a study or provide false information when completing a questionnaire. Study data is being used for real research and inaccurate responses hold back science. If you’re asked a question you feel uncomfortable providing a truthful answer to, in some cases you can skip that question, and in all cases, you are free to quit the study.\nPay attention! You can lose your credits if you responded randomly or without effort. If your responses show you were not reading and thinking, the researchers can take away automatic credit when they review your data. Studies will notify you if you have been denied credit for failing attention checks. If this happens to you, find a new study and pay closer attention.\nYou can quit any study or research alternative at any time. You usually will not receive partial credit for the time you spent on the study. If partial credit is available, that will be explained in that study’s consent.\nResearch and research alternatives have a debriefing form at the end which explains the purpose of the study. This gives you a chance to learn more about research and to ask any questions.\nMake sure you go all the way to the end of the study. The last page, for example, might ask you to click a link or button to finish up. This is necessary to assign you credit.\nRead any post-study instructions carefully. For example, some allow you to choose between entering a raffle and getting SONA credit. For online studies, make sure you click through to the end of the study to ensure credit.\nMost online studies assign credit automatically in which case you should receive credit within a few minutes. Some online studies assign credit manually, as do all face-to-face studies. In this case, it can take up to 1 week for your credit to be posted. If you haven’t been credited by that time, contact the researcher. You don’t need to notify your professor about your credits. They will be handled automatically.\nMany studies don’t begin until about 3-4 weeks into the semester, so don’t worry if there aren’t many available right away. Studies are added and removed throughout the semester, so check back often. If you want to do real studies for your research requirement, don’t wait until the last minute! Many studies close or fill up before the end of the semester.\nDon’t worry if you’re not eligible for some of the posted studies. There will be enough studies and research alternatives available to meet your class requirements.\nMost research alternatives are not made available until the last 2 weeks of the semester, but some may be posted earlier; check back occasionally to see what’s available. You can identify research alternatives because they have the words Research Alternative in the title and the description. Sufficient research alternatives will be made available to ensure that students who are ineligible for or choose not to participate in real research will be able to earn all required credits."

    "text": "Statement in Syllabus\nFor courses that will be requiring students to participate in research studies through SONA, please be sure to include the following information into your syllabus (please copy & paste):\n\nResearch Participation (SONA):\nTo help students learn more about research in psychology, all PSYC 101 classes require students to complete 8 credits worth of participation in research or research alternatives. All of our research is conducted through an online platform called Sona, so research participation credits are called Sona credits.\nSona credits must be completed by 5pm on the last day of classes. If you have fewer than 8 credits by that time, your grade will be lowered by one “step” (i.e., from B+ to B, from C- to D, from D to F). Each study lists how many credits it offers at a rate of 1 credit per 15 minutes of participation, and a 1 credit bonus for in-person studies.\nPlease visit https://ritpsych.github.io/sona/ for more information on how to make an account and complete the research participation requirement.\n\n\n\nPSYC 101 Instructors\n\nAll PSYC 101 classes require students to complete 8 credits worth of participation in research or research alternatives. Students who earn 8 credits should receive the expected grade given their other course performance. If a student who earns fewer than 8 credits, that student’s grade should be lowered by one “step” (i.e., from B+ to B, from C- to D, from D to F). This requirement is pass/fail. There is no partial credit for a student who earns 7 or fewer credits, earns credits after the deadline, or has some other excuse for not participating.\nIf your students tell you that no studies are available, they are not eligible for any studies or for some other reason cannot participate, tell them to check back later - studies change over the course of the semester. If they try to tell you that there were never sufficient studies available, they are mistaken or lying. We have never had a student whose disabilities or other conditions excluded them from every possible study - if you think you might have found the exception, please contact the Sona director.\nAt the end of the semester, I will send you a report of your students’ credits. Your grades should be based on that report. Do not grant additional credits because students said they completed other studies, claim that credit was inappropriately denied, or that a researcher has not yet given them credit they earned. All of those issues are resolved before the report is sent.\nAll of our research / research alternative participation is managed by the Sona system (https://rit.sona-systems.com/). On the website, under the Participants heading, I have posted extensive information about how students can get a Sona account, enroll in studies, and earn credit. There is also an extended FAQ that covers less common questions. Your students should be able to manage most Sona participation without your assistance. If they have questions, tell them to review the guidance available on this site and, if that doesn’t work, to contact the Sona administrator directly (Dr. Dustin Haraden, dxhgsh@rit.edu).\nResearch on Sona is conducted by faculty, graduate students, and undergraduates. Some researchers have studies posted already. Our undergraduate senior project students typically begin posting their projects 2-4 weeks into the semester, so students shouldn’t worry if there are few options initially. Students should be especially encouraged to participate in live studies. Live studies give students more exposure to psychology research methodology and techniques. Students also receive a bonus credit for live studies, above the usual rate.\nAt the beginning of each semester, students will be asked to complete a 5-question prescreen which asks about age (under 18 or 18+), hearing, and vision. This is used to address the most common exclusionary criteria. Most studies have additional participant requirements - students must read the study description in Sona to ensure they are eligible. Each study has exclusion criteria. It is normal for students to be excluded from a few studies, but there are always enough credits available for ALL students to meet the 8-credit requirement.\nResearch alternatives will be made available in the last 2 weeks of the semester for students who cannot or refuse to participate in real research. These fake studies are similar to real research participation and are clearly marked as ‘research alternatives’. All take 20 – 30 minutes to complete online and offer 2 Sona credits, automatically awarded on completion. Other research alternatives may be posted earlier in the semester as well. Students are, of course, encouraged to participate in real research if they are able and willing to do so.\nStudents who indicate they are under 18 in the prescreen will be able to access the research alternatives immediately but will not be allowed to access any other studies. There is no way to change prescreen status during the semester, so a student who turns 18 during the semester has two choices: Complete the prescreen immediately and only do research alternatives OR begin research participation after their birthday and have normal access to studies. Any student who lies about their age on the prescreen will lose ALL credits for the whole semester and will be prohibited from earning more.\nParticipation for the semester ends at 5pm on the last day of classes. Please remind your students of the deadline.\nOnce the participation period ends, the Sona director will process the data. This requires me to contact researchers to resolve any unprocessed credits and may take 1-3 days. As soon as the report is available, I will send it to you. You will receive it early in finals week, well before grades are due. (Please do not email me and ask for it before then - I cannot process the data any faster.) The email will list all students who enrolled in your class on Sona and the number of credits they earned. It is the students’ job to enroll themselves in the correct class, and if they don’t do so, they usually fix the mistake before the semester’s end. However, if your email report contains names not in your class, please let me know.\n\n\nPSYC 200+ Instructors\nWhile Sona registries for PSYC 101 classes are created by default, anyone at the 200+ level choosing to offer extra credit must need to contact the Sona director at the beginning of the semester to have a section created for their class.\nFirst, if you do not already have a Sona instructor account, please email the Sona director so one can be created for you. You should only have one Sona account. If you already have a participant or researcher account, tell the director to add instructor status to your existing account.\nOnce you have instructor access, email the Sona director the following information:\n\nThe days and times of the class (or “Online”)\nThe 3-digit class number (i.e., PSYC 249)\nThe 5-digit unique course code\n\nI will email you a PDF document that you should share with your students."

    "text": "Overview\nHere we can have some overview about SONA and what it means\n\n\nGeneral\n\nSections based on your role\n\n\n\nInfo\nPsychology is a science that relies on data and experimentation. Research determines which theories are well-supported and which should be discarded. Understanding psychology research is important to understanding psychology, which is why all PSYC 101 classes have the research experience requirement.\nThis requirement is pass/fail. If you have 8 credits of research experience by 5pm on the last day of classes, you pass. If you have fewer than 8 credits at that time, your course grade will be marked down the equivalent of one ‘step’ in the plus / minus system (i.e., B+ to B; B- to C+; D to F). This is managed through a system called SONA, which is why participation credits are often called SONA credits. 1 SONA credit is assigned per 15 minutes of participation, so 8 credits require a total of 2 hours’ time.\nFace-to-face studies in which you come in to the lab to do a task require a little more effort than completing surveys on your computer, and they also give you more insight into psychological research. As such, face-to-face studies offer a bonus SONA credit on top of the regular rate. So, a 30-minute online study would award 2 credits, while a 30-minute face-to-face study would award 3. You can tell which ones are face-to-face because they don’t say Online Study in the description.\nYou can earn credits in two ways: You can participate in real research studies OR you can complete research alternatives. You can identify research alternatives because they say Research Alternative next to them in the SONA listing. Research alternatives simulate real studies but do not collect data for analysis. If you can participate in real research, you are encouraged to do so, but participation is voluntary. Research alternatives are provided for students who cannot or choose not to participate in research.\nIf you are under 18, you cannot participate in most research studies because you cannot consent for yourself. You can complete research alternatives without parental consent. However, research alternatives are not available to all students until the last two weeks of class. Minor students (those aged 17 or under) can follow a special procedure to have early access to research alternatives, detailed HERE. This procedure is not required; minor students can still wait until the last two weeks of the semester to complete research alternatives.\nWhether you complete real research or alternatives, you must sign up through http://rit.sona-systems.com to get credit."

    "text": "Try to sign into SONA. If you ever used SONA as a participant, you still have an account. Try this step even if you think you’ve never used SONA. When possible, the SONA administrator is trying to create student researcher accounts ahead of time, so an account may have been created on your behalf.\nYour SONA username is always the letters and numbers that come before @rit.edu in your original RIT email address (i.e., xyz1234 in xyz1234@rit.edu).\nIf you had an account previously, you might need to use the password recovery function to reopen your old account. If a new account was made for you, the temporary password is ‘password’.\nIf no account exists for your username, use the Request Account function to create one. You do not need to select any classes.\n\n\n\nNow that you have an account, sign in and check if you have researcher status. If you do, *Researcher* will be an option for you to select as you log in. Alternatively, you’ll know you’re signed in as a researcher because the   orange bar at the top will say *My Studies*.\n\nIf you do not have researcher status, first obtain a participant account. Then, email the [SONA administrator](mailto:sona@rit.edu) with your full name and original RIT email to request researcher status be added to your existing account.\n\n\n\nOnce steps 1 and 2 are completed, you should be able to log in as a researcher. Do so, and then click on Add New Study before selecting the appropriate study type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStandard Study\n\nLive (face-to-face) study; each participant comes in once\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMulti-Part Standard Study (rare)\n\nLive (face-to-face) study; each participant comes in more than once\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnline Internal Study (not used)\n\nUses SONA as your survey software. Don’t select.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnline External Study\n\nLinks participants to surveys on Qualtrics, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect Credit rather than Paid unless ALL participants will be receiving payment and NONE will be receiving credit.\n\n\n\nPrescreen - The prescreen allows you to target your study to participants by age (18+ or minors). You MUST use the prescreen for age. You can also optionally use the prescreen for four other variables (hearing status, ability to understand oral English, colorblindness, and visual acuity).\n*Study Name* – This should be descriptive, but does not have to reveal your exact hypothesis unless the IRB has specifically said otherwise. Your study name on SONA is not necessarily the same as the title of your research proposal or IRB submission.\nBrief Abstract – This is what participants will see when browsing through the system. It should state in general terms what participants will be asked to do (e.g., take surveys, complete math problems, etc.) and the broad themes or topics (e.g., surveys about your mood and eating habits). This is NOT the same as the abstract you submitted to the IRB or the abstract you would use in a published paper. In most cases you will not reveal your exact hypotheses unless required by the IRB.\nDetailed Description – Participants only see this if they have clicked on the study. Many do not actually read it. If you really need people to read it, you are strongly urged to put, “PLEASE READ THE DETAILED DESCRIPTION BEFORE SIGNING UP” in all caps in the Brief Abstract.\nEligibility Requirements – Do NOT list age as an eligibility requirement; you should have already used the prescreen to ensure participants are 18+. If you have other eligibility requirements that can be managed using the prescreen, please use the prescreen and do not list them here. If you have eligibility requirements other than those covered by the prescreen, please list them here. Note that all Sona users are RIT students, so you can assume they are enrolled in college and able to read English.\nBe aware that sometimes participants sign up for studies without reading the eligibility criteria very carefully. You are strongly encouraged to reiterate your criteria with a few items at the start of your survey to ensure that only eligible people participate.\nDuration – You are required to test-run your study to get the best estimate of duration. Survey questions go much faster than you think, especially because respondents generally don’t spend a lot of time pondering them. Qualtrics’ estimate of duration is incorrect! Do not rely on it!\nCredits – Give a whole number value according to the following table, adding +1 for live studies:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 – 15 minutes\n\n1 credit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16 – 30 minutes\n\n2 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n31 – 45 minutes\n\n3 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n46 – 60 minutes\n\n4 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n61 – 75 minutes\n\n5 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n76 – 90 minutes\n\n6 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n91 – 105 minutes\n\n7 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n106 – 120 minutes\n\n8 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable credits should be used ONLY when participants will be completing different task sets; for example, if all participants will complete a 10 minute screener (1 credit) and some will go on to complete a 30 minute survey (40 minutes total, or 3 credits). The simple fact that some participants will take longer or shorter time to complete the same basic task does NOT mean you should use of variable credits.\nIf you find that average participation is taking considerably longer or shorter than your initial, you should considering changing the credit offering for future participants in the same study, but should give the number of credits promised to the current participants.\nPreparation – (rare) This line refers to actions participants must take (or not take) prior to the study and is usually left blank. An examples of a requirement that might go in this space would be, “Must not eat any solid food for 60 minutes prior your scheduled start time.”\nResearcher – You will be selected automatically. Add your faculty mentor and any other collaborators.\nIRB Approval Code – Our IRB (HSRO) does not provide approval codes per se. Instead, enter the date listed on your IRB decision form (Form C) in MMDDYYYY format.\nNext is a line that says Approved? which is handled by the SONA director.\nActive Study – If you want your study to be visible as soon as it’s approved, select yes. If you want your study to start out hidden, select no. Reasons to select no would include wanting to wait until a specific part of the semester to collect data. Once you have finished collecting your data, please set your study to inactive by selecting No. You can change this setting whenever you like, without needing SONA director approval. PSYC 101 students get frustrated when they try to find studies with available time slots. Setting your completed study to inactive clears it from the available study list, making it easier for PSYC 101 students to find active research.\n\n\n\nMost of these should be left in the default position. If an option is marked (rare), it should be left alone unless your study specifically requires it. That said, virtually every study will use at least some advanced settings. A few apply to many studies and are marked (common).\nPrerequisites (rare) – Use if people must be in a previous study before they can be in yours. Note that this does not automatically link their Study A responses to their Study B responses – you have to do that yourself.\nDisqualifiers (rare) – This disqualifies participants based on other studies they’ve enrolled in. It’s mainly used if people cannot be in two similar studies or two forms of the same study.\nCourse Restrictions (rare) – Use if you only want participants from specific courses or sections. Most participants are in PSYC101. Some are in other psychology classes that allow participation for extra credit.\nInvitation Code (rare) – Use if you’re going to give out personal invitations to specific people as a means of carefully screening participants.\nThe next few options are important for online studies.\nShould survey participants be identified only by a random, unique ID code? (common for online) – This defaults to ‘No’ which means that participant names will be used rather than numerical codes. The names or codes appear in two places. First, they’re listed in timeslot sign ups. Second, if you set up Qualtrics and SONA to automatically grant credit, the name or code will be in your data output file. In most cases, you should switch this option to ‘Yes’, meaning that anonymous codes will be used in place of names. Automatic credit assignment will work either way, and the use of code numbers increases participant privacy. If you have told the IRB that you will not be collecting participants’ names, you must select ‘Yes’.\nStudy URL (common for online) – If you’re using a survey instrument like Qualtrics, enter the URL here. If you’re going to automatically assign credit (highly recommended), enter the URL from Qualtrics and add this text at the end:\n?id=%SURVEY_CODE%\n\nSo, https://rit.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_b9ZD41hMdsaqE becomes\n\nhttps://rit.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_b9ZD41hMdsaqE**?id=%SURVEY_CODE%**\nIf you are using Qualtrics, you should set it up to grant credit automatically to those who complete the study. A brief version of the directions is provided below. (Detailed version HERE.)\n\nMake sure you put ?id=%SURVEY_CODE% at the end of your survey URL when you set it up in SONA.\n\nOnce you’ve finished adjusting the Advanced Settings and you’ve hit Add This Study, you’ll be taken to the Study Information page. Scroll down to the row labeled Website. You should see the words Qualtrics Redirect to a URL above a grey box with a web address in it. Hold onto this. You’ll need it in a moment.\n\nSwitch over to Qualtrics. While in your survey in Qualtrics, look at the top of the page, below the Qualtrics four-circle logo and the word Survey, to see Survey Flow. Click on that and a window will open up. In that window, select Add a New Element Here followed by Embedded Data. A green box with a dropdown menu will appear. Type ‘id’ (two letters, lowercase, no punctuation, nothing else) and hit enter. This green box can be anywhere in the order of your survey. Hit OK to close Survey Flow.\n\nNext to Survey Flow is a link labeled Survey Options. Click it and scroll down until you see the Survey Termination options. Select Redirect to a Full URL and paste the URL from the grey box in SONA under Qualtrics Redirect to a URL from step two.\n\nOnce you’ve saved all your changes in Qualtrics, go back to SONA and again find the box labeled Website under Study Information. There should be an orange box labeled Sample Link with Embedded ID Code. Click on it and you should be taken to the first page of your study, like a participant. Take your entire study and if everything is working properly, at the end, you should be automatically redirected back to SONA. If it works, it will say, System Message: No credit given, because you are not a participant, and therefore cannot sign up for this study. That means you have successfully set up your study to automatically grant credit.\n \n\nYour study should begin with a consent form that kicks people out if they do not consent. Do not simply redirect them to the end of the study. That will cause them to receive Sona credit for not participating. Instead, in Survey Flow, branch to the End of Survey. In the End of Survey block, click Customize, then Override Survey Options and Redirect to a URL. Set it to redirect to www.rit.edu.\nIf your study has a choice between receiving Sona credit or participating in a raffle, you must ensure that no participant receives both Sona credit and a raffle entry. To do this, at the end of the study, put a forced-choice multiple choice question asking whether the participant would like Sona credit or a raffle entry. The Sona credit option should redirect back to the Qualtrics Redirect to a URL web address you obtained from Sona. The raffle entry option should redirect participants to a separate Qualtrics survey that collects raffle information.\nStudy URL Display (rare) – Toggles whether participants can see the actual study URL, even after finishing; defaults to ‘no’. This prevents participants from re-entering the survey and causing problems. Only switch to ‘yes’ if they are going to be required to re-enter for some reason.\nThis next few options are important for live studies.\nParticipant Sign Up Deadline (common for live) – For live studies, this prevents participants from signing up right before a timeslot. It defaults to 24 hours, meaning they must give you at least 1 day’s notice to participate. You can make this longer or shorter according to your needs. Online studies should ignore this.\nParticipant Cancellation Deadline(common for live) – Live study participants will be told that they must cancel at least this many hours before their scheduled time. If they cancel at least that far in advance, you should assign them an excused absence. If they cancel after the cancellation deadline, the absence can be considered unexcused. Online studies should ignore this.\nShould the Researcher receive an email notification when a participant signs up or cancels? (common for live) – This is very useful for researchers conducting live studies to keep track of signups and cancellations. Live study researchers should consider selecting ‘yes’. Online studies should ignore this.\nResearchers at Timeslot-Level (common for live) – This is generally used in larger studies with one lead investigator and many research assistants. It means that different researchers or research assistants can open their own set of available timeslots that they manage individually.\nThe final two options apply to both live and online studies, but are both very rare.\nComments Section (rare) – Use this if you want to explain to the administrator why an unusual choice was made.\nResearch Alternative (rare) – Only the system administrator can change this. It toggles to yes when SONA credit is offered for a task that is not research, such as aiding in practice test administration or gathering data for a class exercise. If you have made arrangements with the SONA administrator to offer a research alternative, email the administrator a reminder of this when you request that your study be approved.\nOnce you have made your selections for all of the above, click [Add This Study]{.underline} to move forward.\n\n\n\nAfter clicking Add This Study, You will be brought to a Study Information page. Check that everything is correct. Under Study Status, you will have an option to Send Request for approval of your study. Be sure to hit this button so that your study can be approved by the SONA administrator.\nYou must also email the SONA administrator directly with basic information about your study (your name, your study’s name), and your plans to comply with our SONA regulations.\nYou will see an option to set Prescreen Restrictions. If you have not yet set your prescreen restrictions, do so now. Remember, you must use the prescreen for age. You may use the prescreen for hearing status, ability to understand oral English, colorblindness, or visual acuity.\n\n\n\nThis occurs after your study is approved by the SONA administrator and set to Active. Participants cannot sign up until you create timeslots. Go to Study Menu, then View / Administer Timeslots. If you are creating a live study, you should make lots of little time slots for all the possible times you can test subjects, usually with a maximum of one participant per timeslot.\nIf you are creating an online study, you should create a single large timeslot. I recommend the timeslot be one week in duration. During the first week, this timeslot should have a maximum number of participants     equal to the maximum number of participants you intend to recruit, according to your research plan and department regulations.\n\nAt the end of that week, create a new timeslot, with a maximum number of participants equal to the total number you need minus the number you’ve already recruited.\nIf you are recruiting a control group (majority) and a target group (less common trait), begin by accepting all participants. Once you have the total number of majority participants you need, change your eligibility criteria so you are only recruiting target group participants. So, if you want 30 Deaf and 30 Hearing, you would begin by accepting all participants. Then, when you have 30 Hearing participants, you would change your eligibility criteria to permit only Deaf participants.\n\n\n\nEnter SONA as a researcher, go to My Studies, and click on [Timeslots]{.underline} at the right side of the row. Click on any individual time slot to address it. Each row will be labeled by an ID code or name.

    "text": "Prescreen - The prescreen allows you to target your study to participants by age (18+ or minors). You MUST use the prescreen for age. You can also optionally use the prescreen for four other variables (hearing status, ability to understand oral English, colorblindness, and visual acuity).\n*Study Name* – This should be descriptive, but does not have to reveal your exact hypothesis unless the IRB has specifically said otherwise. Your study name on SONA is not necessarily the same as the title of your research proposal or IRB submission.\nBrief Abstract – This is what participants will see when browsing through the system. It should state in general terms what participants will be asked to do (e.g., take surveys, complete math problems, etc.) and the broad themes or topics (e.g., surveys about your mood and eating habits). This is NOT the same as the abstract you submitted to the IRB or the abstract you would use in a published paper. In most cases you will not reveal your exact hypotheses unless required by the IRB.\nDetailed Description – Participants only see this if they have clicked on the study. Many do not actually read it. If you really need people to read it, you are strongly urged to put, “PLEASE READ THE DETAILED DESCRIPTION BEFORE SIGNING UP” in all caps in the Brief Abstract.\nEligibility Requirements – Do NOT list age as an eligibility requirement; you should have already used the prescreen to ensure participants are 18+. If you have other eligibility requirements that can be managed using the prescreen, please use the prescreen and do not list them here. If you have eligibility requirements other than those covered by the prescreen, please list them here. Note that all Sona users are RIT students, so you can assume they are enrolled in college and able to read English.\nBe aware that sometimes participants sign up for studies without reading the eligibility criteria very carefully. You are strongly encouraged to reiterate your criteria with a few items at the start of your survey to ensure that only eligible people participate.\nDuration – You are required to test-run your study to get the best estimate of duration. Survey questions go much faster than you think, especially because respondents generally don’t spend a lot of time pondering them. Qualtrics’ estimate of duration is incorrect! Do not rely on it!\nCredits – Give a whole number value according to the following table, adding +1 for live studies:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 – 15 minutes\n\n1 credit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16 – 30 minutes\n\n2 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n31 – 45 minutes\n\n3 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n46 – 60 minutes\n\n4 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n61 – 75 minutes\n\n5 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n76 – 90 minutes\n\n6 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n91 – 105 minutes\n\n7 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n106 – 120 minutes\n\n8 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable credits should be used ONLY when participants will be completing different task sets; for example, if all participants will complete a 10 minute screener (1 credit) and some will go on to complete a 30 minute survey (40 minutes total, or 3 credits). The simple fact that some participants will take longer or shorter time to complete the same basic task does NOT mean you should use of variable credits.\nIf you find that average participation is taking considerably longer or shorter than your initial, you should considering changing the credit offering for future participants in the same study, but should give the number of credits promised to the current participants.\nPreparation – (rare) This line refers to actions participants must take (or not take) prior to the study and is usually left blank. An examples of a requirement that might go in this space would be, “Must not eat any solid food for 60 minutes prior your scheduled start time.”\nResearcher – You will be selected automatically. Add your faculty mentor and any other collaborators.\nIRB Approval Code – Our IRB (HSRO) does not provide approval codes per se. Instead, enter the date listed on your IRB decision form (Form C) in MMDDYYYY format.\nNext is a line that says Approved? which is handled by the SONA director.\nActive Study – If you want your study to be visible as soon as it’s approved, select yes. If you want your study to start out hidden, select no. Reasons to select no would include wanting to wait until a specific part of the semester to collect data. Once you have finished collecting your data, please set your study to inactive by selecting No. You can change this setting whenever you like, without needing SONA director approval. PSYC 101 students get frustrated when they try to find studies with available time slots. Setting your completed study to inactive clears it from the available study list, making it easier for PSYC 101 students to find active research."

    "text": "Most of these should be left in the default position. If an option is marked (rare), it should be left alone unless your study specifically requires it. That said, virtually every study will use at least some advanced settings. A few apply to many studies and are marked (common).\nPrerequisites (rare) – Use if people must be in a previous study before they can be in yours. Note that this does not automatically link their Study A responses to their Study B responses – you have to do that yourself.\nDisqualifiers (rare) – This disqualifies participants based on other studies they’ve enrolled in. It’s mainly used if people cannot be in two similar studies or two forms of the same study.\nCourse Restrictions (rare) – Use if you only want participants from specific courses or sections. Most participants are in PSYC101. Some are in other psychology classes that allow participation for extra credit.\nInvitation Code (rare) – Use if you’re going to give out personal invitations to specific people as a means of carefully screening participants.\nThe next few options are important for online studies.\nShould survey participants be identified only by a random, unique ID code? (common for online) – This defaults to ‘No’ which means that participant names will be used rather than numerical codes. The names or codes appear in two places. First, they’re listed in timeslot sign ups. Second, if you set up Qualtrics and SONA to automatically grant credit, the name or code will be in your data output file. In most cases, you should switch this option to ‘Yes’, meaning that anonymous codes will be used in place of names. Automatic credit assignment will work either way, and the use of code numbers increases participant privacy. If you have told the IRB that you will not be collecting participants’ names, you must select ‘Yes’.\nStudy URL (common for online) – If you’re using a survey instrument like Qualtrics, enter the URL here. If you’re going to automatically assign credit (highly recommended), enter the URL from Qualtrics and add this text at the end:\n?id=%SURVEY_CODE%\n\nSo, https://rit.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_b9ZD41hMdsaqE becomes\n\nhttps://rit.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_b9ZD41hMdsaqE**?id=%SURVEY_CODE%**\nIf you are using Qualtrics, you should set it up to grant credit automatically to those who complete the study. A brief version of the directions is provided below. (Detailed version HERE.)\n\nMake sure you put ?id=%SURVEY_CODE% at the end of your survey URL when you set it up in SONA.\n\nOnce you’ve finished adjusting the Advanced Settings and you’ve hit Add This Study, you’ll be taken to the Study Information page. Scroll down to the row labeled Website. You should see the words Qualtrics Redirect to a URL above a grey box with a web address in it. Hold onto this. You’ll need it in a moment.\n\nSwitch over to Qualtrics. While in your survey in Qualtrics, look at the top of the page, below the Qualtrics four-circle logo and the word Survey, to see Survey Flow. Click on that and a window will open up. In that window, select Add a New Element Here followed by Embedded Data. A green box with a dropdown menu will appear. Type ‘id’ (two letters, lowercase, no punctuation, nothing else) and hit enter. This green box can be anywhere in the order of your survey. Hit OK to close Survey Flow.\n\nNext to Survey Flow is a link labeled Survey Options. Click it and scroll down until you see the Survey Termination options. Select Redirect to a Full URL and paste the URL from the grey box in SONA under Qualtrics Redirect to a URL from step two.\n\nOnce you’ve saved all your changes in Qualtrics, go back to SONA and again find the box labeled Website under Study Information. There should be an orange box labeled Sample Link with Embedded ID Code. Click on it and you should be taken to the first page of your study, like a participant. Take your entire study and if everything is working properly, at the end, you should be automatically redirected back to SONA. If it works, it will say, System Message: No credit given, because you are not a participant, and therefore cannot sign up for this study. That means you have successfully set up your study to automatically grant credit.\n \n\nYour study should begin with a consent form that kicks people out if they do not consent. Do not simply redirect them to the end of the study. That will cause them to receive Sona credit for not participating. Instead, in Survey Flow, branch to the End of Survey. In the End of Survey block, click Customize, then Override Survey Options and Redirect to a URL. Set it to redirect to www.rit.edu.\nIf your study has a choice between receiving Sona credit or participating in a raffle, you must ensure that no participant receives both Sona credit and a raffle entry. To do this, at the end of the study, put a forced-choice multiple choice question asking whether the participant would like Sona credit or a raffle entry. The Sona credit option should redirect back to the Qualtrics Redirect to a URL web address you obtained from Sona. The raffle entry option should redirect participants to a separate Qualtrics survey that collects raffle information.\nStudy URL Display (rare) – Toggles whether participants can see the actual study URL, even after finishing; defaults to ‘no’. This prevents participants from re-entering the survey and causing problems. Only switch to ‘yes’ if they are going to be required to re-enter for some reason.\nThis next few options are important for live studies.\nParticipant Sign Up Deadline (common for live) – For live studies, this prevents participants from signing up right before a timeslot. It defaults to 24 hours, meaning they must give you at least 1 day’s notice to participate. You can make this longer or shorter according to your needs. Online studies should ignore this.\nParticipant Cancellation Deadline(common for live) – Live study participants will be told that they must cancel at least this many hours before their scheduled time. If they cancel at least that far in advance, you should assign them an excused absence. If they cancel after the cancellation deadline, the absence can be considered unexcused. Online studies should ignore this.\nShould the Researcher receive an email notification when a participant signs up or cancels? (common for live) – This is very useful for researchers conducting live studies to keep track of signups and cancellations. Live study researchers should consider selecting ‘yes’. Online studies should ignore this.\nResearchers at Timeslot-Level (common for live) – This is generally used in larger studies with one lead investigator and many research assistants. It means that different researchers or research assistants can open their own set of available timeslots that they manage individually.\nThe final two options apply to both live and online studies, but are both very rare.\nComments Section (rare) – Use this if you want to explain to the administrator why an unusual choice was made.\nResearch Alternative (rare) – Only the system administrator can change this. It toggles to yes when SONA credit is offered for a task that is not research, such as aiding in practice test administration or gathering data for a class exercise. If you have made arrangements with the SONA administrator to offer a research alternative, email the administrator a reminder of this when you request that your study be approved.\nOnce you have made your selections for all of the above, click [Add This Study]{.underline} to move forward."

If you are creating a live study, you should make lots of little time slots for all the possible times you can test subjects, usually with a maximum of one participant per timeslot.\nIf you are creating an online study, you should create a single large timeslot. I recommend the timeslot be one week in duration. During the first week, this timeslot should have a maximum number of participants     equal to the maximum number of participants you intend to recruit, according to your research plan and department regulations.\n\nAt the end of that week, create a new timeslot, with a maximum number of participants equal to the total number you need minus the number you’ve already recruited.\nIf you are recruiting a control group (majority) and a target group (less common trait), begin by accepting all participants. Once you have the total number of majority participants you need, change your eligibility criteria so you are only recruiting target group participants. So, if you want 30 Deaf and 30 Hearing, you would begin by accepting all participants. Then, when you have 30 Hearing participants, you would change your eligibility criteria to permit only Deaf participants."
