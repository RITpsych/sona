Participating in this study will involve you completing a brief set of questionnaires via an online platform and your participation will last approximately 25 minutes.

This research will be performed online through the Rochester Institute of Technology using the online data collection software called Qualtrics. You will only need to complete the questionnaire, but will be asked if you would like to participate in additional follow-ups for the current study. You will be presented with another consent form at that time that provides additional information.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nUpon agreeing to participate in the current study, you will complete a series of questionnaires that ask about topics related to sleep habits, mental and physical health, stress and personality among others.

Statistical analyses will be based on aggregate data (i.e., summaries of the group). Any identifying information will be kept in a secure password protected file that only the principal investigator and senior research personnel will have access to.&nbsp; All data that is processed by students and additional research personnel will be de-identified by using an ID number to represent each participant.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nYour de-identified data may also be shared with other researchers around the world or with a publicly available data archive.&nbsp; In such cases, every reasonable effort will be made to remove any potentially identifiable information from the data that would indicate any connection to you (e.g. the removal of your name, birthdate, etc.).<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>Will I be reimbursed for any expenses or paid for my participation in this research?<\/strong><br \/>\nYou will have the option to receive compensation in the form of course credit or financial compensation.
