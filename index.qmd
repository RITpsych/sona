# Overview

This course is the introduction to statistics for graduate students. The goal of the course is to provide a grounding in statistical concepts, methods and application to research. I aim to increase student's confidence in using these techniques and introducing them to R. Topics will range from including mathematical conceptualizations to practical application with various techniques ranging from descriptive statistics to ending with regression.

The course will be broken up into two main sections. The first will be getting used to using R and the practicalities of performing a data analysis. The second section will then "pop the hood" of these tools with a deeper understanding of the how and why.
