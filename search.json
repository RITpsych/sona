    "text": "How can I be sure to get my credit?\nIn all cases, be sure that you sign up for / access the study through Sona. For example, if you sign up through a paper advertisement tear-off strip that sends you directly to a study website, you may not be eligible for Sona credit.\nComplete the study to the best of your ability. If you give answers without really reading the questions and responding thoughtfully, your credit can be revoked.\nMost online studies grant credit automatically and more or less immediately. To make sure this works, complete the entire study through to the very end. Don’t skip the debriefing or other final pages. In most cases, the last page will have automatically redirected you back to Sona. In other cases, there may be a clickable link back to Sona. (In a few cases, there will be a choice between entering your email for a raffle or clicking back to Sona for credit – you can pick one or the other.)\nFor face-to-face studies, show up. You can double-check that the researcher has the correct information on you. Some online studies input credit manually as well. In both of these cases, researchers have to log on and manually apply credit, often done in batches every week or so.\n\n\nHow do I sign up for studies?\nOn Sona, you can browse the full list of studies currently active. The order of studies is randomized each time you open the page. The list contains the name of each study and a brief description of what’s involved. If you click through, you can read a more detailed description.\nThe prescreen checks for a couple of common eligibility criteria. You won’t be shown certain studies that are inconsistent with your prescreen answers. However, plenty of studies have other eligibility criteria, so read them carefuly. Requirements might pertain to motor or sensory abilities, your major, your religion, your relationship status, or anything else. In most cases, it will be clear whether you meet the eligibility criteria or not, but if you’re really unsure, you can email the researcher.\nIf you’re signing up for a live, face-to-face study, you’ll pick a specific timeslot when you will meet the researcher in their lab – that will almost always be in Eastman (Building 1). For these studies, you’re usually required to sign up a certain length of time (e.g., 12 hours, 24 hours) before your scheduled appointment.\nIf you’re signing up for an online study, you can usually complete it at any time before the end of the timeslot, which is often several days or weeks long. There’s no real advantage to signing up ahead of time, and it can create some confusion on the researcher’s end. Thus, when possible for online studies only, it’s probably best to sign up when you intend to do the study.\n\n\nI’m a minor. What do I do?\nMinors cannot consent to real research, so they must do research alternatives instead. If you indicate that you are under 18 on your prescreen, you will be granted immediate access to research alternatives and you will be prohibited from accessing real research. If you lie and say you are under 18 when you are 18+ or vice versa, you will lose all credits for the semester and be prohibited form earning more.\nBonus question: If I’m 17 and will turn 18 during the course of the semester, what should I put on the prescreen?\nYour prescreen answers cannot be changed over the course of the semester, so you have two choices: If you complete the prescreen before your birthday, you will have immediate access to the research alternatives, but will be barred from real research. If you wait until your birthday and indicate you are 18, you will be able to do real research, but you will be unable to do research alternatives until they open up for everyone in the last two weeks of the semester.\n\n\nI only completed half the study before I quit / was abducted by sasquatch / developed an allergy to wi-fi. Do I still get credit?\nMost studies only grant credit if you complete the entire thing. Occasionally, a study will specify in its consent form that it offers partial credit. If it does not indicate it offers partial credit, you get nothing unless you finish the study.\n\n\nI wanted to be in Study X but I can’t find it.\nGood. Unauthorized X-men research is very dangerous. Look what they did to Wolverine.\n(And I know, that wasn’t X-men research, that was Department H of the Canadian government. Nobody email me with that little pearl of wisdom.)\nA study might not be shown to you because your prescreen indicated you were ineligible, or it may not currently be recruiting. Studies close down for a range of reasons. They may have all the participants they need. In rare cases, they have temporarily paused data collection and will resume later.However, if it’s no longer listed in Sona, it’s almost certainly over. Still, if you want to learn more about it, you can contact the researcher.\nIn other cases, the study was never on Sona to begin with. If you’ve seen it advertised around campus, it may not run through the Sona system, in which case you are free to participate but will not get Sona credit.\n\n\nIt says there aren’t any studies with timeslots today.\nYou can select an option to show only studies with timeslots today. However, this only applies to studies that have separate timeslots for each participant – mostly studies that are conducted face-to-face. Online studies usually have one giant timeslot stretching over several days or weeks. The system doesn’t read this as having a timeslot today for some reason. As such, the Studies with Timeslots Today function isn’t very useful if you’re looking for online studies. You can complete an online study at any time during that long timeslot, as long as you’re done before the deadline.\n\n\nMy credit isn’t there. I should freak out, right?\nFor an online study that redirected you back to Sona after completion, wait 24 hours before worrying. Sometimes the system is a little clunky.\n\n\nFor face-to-face studies or online studies without automatic redirects back to Sona, wait one week.\nIf you haven’t gotten credit by then, a polite email to the researcher is fine. (Etiquette pro-tip: Some researchers are faculty and some are students. If you’re not sure which, you’re talking to, assume you’re talking to faculty.) Researchers know your credit is due at the end of the semester and they will be reminded by the Sona administrator - you don’t have to worry about reminding them of that.\nIt is also possible that you were denied credit due to random or careless responding. Click HERE for more information. If this happens to you, give up on that study and find a new one.\n\n\nCool, so I’ll skip doing the study and then email the researcher for credit.\nWe have a number of ways of verifying whether you actually completed the study. False claims of doing so are academic dishonesty and will be dealt with accordingly.\n\n\nMy internet cut out and I’m not sure if my survey responses were registered.\nThat’s not a question, but I’ll answer it anyway.\nIf as you’re going through the survey, you keep finding that pages are timing out, having display errors, etc., you would probably be best off (1) finding another study to participate in (2) attempting the survey when your internet connection is stronger or (3) completing surveys on a different computer.\nIf you make it all the way to the end, answered every question, and went through every page, your responses were probably registered. If you did all that and were not issued Sona credit after 24 hours, email the researcher your name, Sona username, the date and time you took the survey, and your responses to a few of the demographic questions that were asked in the study. That will allow the researcher to locate your response even if the survey is anonymous and credit you accordingly. The researcher may or may not grant you credit - for example, you might have thought you finished the study, but you really didn’t. In these cases, the researcher’s decision is final.\n\n\nThere’s a study I want to participate in, but there are never any open timeslots.\nOccasionally, timeslots aren’t available because the researcher is out of town, or other students already took all the timeslots. In that case, check back again in a few days. However, when researchers finish collecting data or, they stop opening up timeslots. Eventually the study will be switched over to Inactive and will stop appearing in the Student view, but it might hang around in the Active studies list for a while, tantalizingly out of reach. In that case, you’ll have to find a different study.\n\n\nThis is easy! I can just click on random answers and still get credit, right?\nPlease don’t do that, for three reasons.\nFor real studies, researchers, including your professors and fellow students, are relying on this data to be honest. Random or inattentive responding messes up their research and can even harm scientific progress. The purpose of the Sona assignment is for you to learn about psychology research by participating in real or simulated research tasks. If you’re not paying attention, you’re not learning anything. Many studies (including Research Alternatives) have built-in checks to make sure that you’re paying attention and not just clicking randomly. Just like your instructor might deny your attendance credit if you spend all of class texting, if you fail too many of these attention checks, real studies and research alternatives reserve the right to deny you credit.\n\n\nHow can I be the best little lab rat?\nYou can’t. Pinky and the Brain have the market cornered. However, there are a few things participants can do to really improve the quality of research data:\nBe honest. Don’t lie about eligibility criteria or survey answers. If you don’t want to give an honest answer to a survey question, it’s better to leave it blank than to lie. Some studies won’t allow you to skip questions. If questions upset or offend you, you can quit the study. Read the instructions and then follow them. Most studies contain more than one survey and each one has its own directions. The list of answer choices usually changes from one survey to another as well. Pay attention. Researchers have ways to tell if you’re clicking randomly. Ideally, complete your participation in a non-distracting environment, without videos, texting, games, etc. on in the background. Remember, your credit can be revoked if you respond without effort. Give feedback, if necessary. If an item really bothered you, didn’t make sense, or used a phrase you didn’t understand, feel free to contact the researcher with that information. This lets researchers know where potential data problems may be and helps them with their analysis.\n\n\nWait, that’s not fair. I did the study! (I mean, I closed my eyes and picked random response boxes, until it said I was done…) Why did my credit disappear?\nThe purpose of the research participation requirement is for you to learn more about research. You are supposed to receive credit for actively participating in research (or research alternatives), which means reading the instructions, thinking about the questions, and answering truthfully. You are not automatically owed credit for clicking the mouse one hundred times. You’re not learning about research if you’re not reading, understanding, and responding with effort.\nSo how does credit get granted and then taken away? For many online studies, credit is granted automatically when you click that last box. Researchers do this because it’s convenient for everyone and they assume that most people will put forth good effort. Some studies have built-in ways of detecting inattentive responding and will automatically deny you credit. Other studies are checking whether you’re paying attention, but they go back and deny credit manually.\nImagine you offered a neighbor $20 to rake the leaves in your yard, but instead of raking leaves, your neighbor just leaned on the rake while playing Candy Crush. Wouldn’t you want your $20 back? Just being on the study website is not the same as completing this assignment.\n\n\nHow flexible is the participation requirement and due date for PSYC 101? What if I have 6 or 7 credits finished? Or what if I was working on studies when the due date and time passed?\nThe participation requirement is not at all flexible. Only two hours of your time (often less) are required; this is a very reasonable amount of time to ask you to put toward homework for a college class. There are always enough studies and research alternatives that every student can complete all 8 credits. The requirement is Pass/Fail - the effect on your PSYC 101 grade is the same whether you have 0 credits or 7 credits.\nYou must complete participation by 5pm on the last day of classes. That’s the last day of classes, not the last day of exams. Any participation after that time will not count. You can check the current RIT Calendar to verfiy the date. Find the appropriate semester and look for the day labeled “Last day, evening, and online classes”. Once 5pm on the last day of classes has passed, you cannot earn any more Sona credit for the semester.\nIn rare cases, a student will complete a study before the deadline, but because credit is being assigned manually, the researcher may not grant credit immediately. In this case, the student does get credit. All open timeslots are checked and resolved before instructors receive a report of their class’s Sona credits.\n\n\nDoes it matter which course I sign up for in Sona? As long as I’m in PSYC 101, I should be okay, right? Or maybe I should enroll in all the PSYC 101 courses, just to be safe.\nPLEASE don’t do this. When the semester ends, your credit will be sent to the instructor of the course(s) you enrolled in. If you enroll in the wrong Sona course section, your results will be sent to the wrong instructor. I realize that there are several PSYC 101 sections running each semester, so I make sure that the course labels include a lot of information that you can use to ensure you find the right course. Look for the correct instructor, 5-digit code, and days/times.\nIt is NOT the responsibility of your instructor or the Sona director to make sure you are enrolled in the right course. If you fail to register correctly, you may be denied your credits.\nSome students try to resolve this problem by signing up for every course. Again, please don’t do this. It only makes it harder for me to ensure you get credit for your work in the end.\n\n\nMy credit disappeared! (Or, I didn’t get credit when I expected to!) Is there an appeals process?\nFirst, check whether you completed the whole study correctly. Some online studies, for example, have multiple debriefing pages and you may have quit too soon. For studies that grant credit manually, wait a reasonable length of time (usually one week) for the researcher to assign credit.\nIf you got were participating in a study while daydreaming, doing something else, or otherwise responding without thinking at least some of the time, please go find a new study.\nIf you honestly think there was a mistake, you should email the researcher AND copy the Sona director. If you do not copy the Sona director, your appeal will be automatically denied. In your email, you should indicate what the study was, what it was about, and the date and time at which you took it. It is up to the researcher to decide whether to grant Sona credit. The Sona director will keep a list of people who have sought appeals. Abuse of the appeals process is a form of academic dishonesty and will be dealt with appropriately.\n\n\nWhat if I can’t or don’t want to participate in research?\nTo answer that, you need to understand the definition of research. For ethics purposes, ‘research’ doesn’t just mean administering a survey or conducting an experiment. It means collecting data in an attempt to investigate a hypothesis and improve the state of scientific knowledge, usually by sharing the results at a scientific conference or in a published paper. It’s unethical for us to force you to participate in research and we absolutely do not. On the other hand, it’s perfectly reasonable for a course instructor to expect you to complete educational activities to earn your course grade. Thus, we offer Research Alternative tasks, which are very similar to research, but don’t involve data collection to investigate a hypothesis. It’s like a research simulator.\nParticipating in real research helps faculty and student investigators. However, if you are unable or unwilling to do so, you can earn your Sona credit via Research Alternative tasks.\nTwo weeks before the end of the semester, several Research Alternatives will be made available to everyone on Sona, enough that you will be able to get all of your required course credit through Research Alternatives. These online studies simulate real research studies but will never be used to collect data for publication. They are completely anonymous and do not address any topics that most people would consider personally sensitive. Your data is temporarily linked to your Sona account number – this is so credit can be assigned. The Sona account number link will be destroyed after the semester ends.\nResearch alternatives are no easier or faster than comparable real research studies. The only difference is that they are not research. There may be other Research Alternatives available earlier in the semester. They are always clearly marked in Sona.\nMinors cannot consent to real research, so they must do research alternatives instead. If you indicate that you are under 18 on your prescreen, you will be granted immediate access to research alternatives and you will be prohibited from accessing real research. If you lie and say you are under 18 when you are 18+ or vice versa, you will lose all credits for the semester and be prohibited form earning more.\nYou might also choose research alternatives because you are not eligible for other studies or you simply don’t want to do research. According to the ethical rules that govern human research, you don’t need a reason to refuse to participate. If you can participate but you don’t want to, that’s okay. Just complete Research Alternatives instead.\nSome students avoid particular studies because they are uncomfortable with research risks. The research alternatives all involve no more risk than everyday life - you might feel a little bored or frustrated, for example. Real research usually involves minimal risk as well, but some studies involve slightly more risk. The most common risks are:\n· Boredom or fatigue when completing surveys or doing a repetitive task\n· Frustration when attempting a difficult task\n· Mild emotional discomfort when asked to view stimuli or complete surveys on topics you have strong feelings about\nRisks are different for everyone. For example, most people would feel a little uncomfortable looking at a picture of a spider. A few people would feel happy, and a few would feel extremely uncomfortable. Looking at a picture of a spider would not be high-risk for most people, but a few people may feel differently. That’s why each study begins with a consent form that lets you decide for yourself how you feel about the risks. The consent form that begins each study contains more information about the specific risks of participation. You can always contact the researcher for further information if you think that will help you decide.\nSince most research studies have similar risks to everyday life, research alternative tasks may also have some of the same risks. For example, one research alternative task requires participants to solve difficult word problems that might be frustrating. Another asks students to complete a survey about becoming an adult, which might cause mild emotional discomfort if you have strong feelings about that topic. Research alternative tasks do not collect personally identifying information and will never be shared with the scientific community (for example, the data will never be shown at a conference or published in a journal). However, the anonymous data may be used by psychology students to practice statistics and research skills. Research alternative tasks do not have an official consent form, because that’s an element of real research. However, they do begin with a document that gives you some idea of the tasks and topics involved so you can choose whether or not to participate.\n\n\nWhat should I do if I sign up for a face-to-face study, but can’t make it / am late / forgot about it?\nIf at all possible, contact the researcher right away. Remember that some researchers will be coming in just to meet with you and others will be sitting around waiting for you to show up. Even if you’ve missed your appointment entirely, it’s still good form to contact them. They may or may not allow you to reschedule, if you would like.\nIf you persistently schedule live research timeslots and fail to show up, you may be prohibited from participating in live research.\n\n\nWho should I contact if I have a question or problem?\nI have created very extensive documentation for students, available on my website at https://people.rit.edu/amsgss. Please go there first. If that does not answer your questions, try the following resources:\nIf you have a question about the PSYC 101 research participation requirement, it is almost certainly answered in the documentation on my website and provided by your instructor. Check if you can access the information or solve the problem yourself. You can see whether a study has assigned them credits and how many credits you have earned in total through your own Sona accounts. If you enrolled in or assigned credits to the wrong class, you can fix that too. If there’s a question about research ethics - for example, if you feel your participant rights were violated - you should contact RIT’s Human Subjects Research Office. If you have a question about the PSYC 101 research participation requirement, or about Sona extra credit, ask your instructor. If the question is about the content of a specific study or when credits will be assigned, contact the researcher(s) directly. If you are disputing a decision to deny credit for a particular study, contact the researcher directly AND the Sona director. ONLY if those resources do not answer the question should you contact the Sona director, Dr. Alan Smerbeck.\nThere is one exception: If the you incorrectly enter your username when setting up an account (e.g., enter abc1235 instead of abc1234 or enters anything other than your RIT username), you must contact the Sona director to resolve the issue."

    "title": "SONA Regulations & Recommendations",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Regulations for ALL Researchers\nRecruitment by directly or indirectly contacting PSYC 101 classes is prohibited. Recruitment through social media, email, flyers, etc. must be approved by the IRB, including content, medium, and target. All studies must exclude minors (below age 18) unless they have specific approval from the IRB to obtain parental consent. Studies must have and document reasonable procedures in place to ensure that, with minimal error, credit only goes to those who were eligible and validly completed the study. (Partial credit for partial completion can be validly assigned if in accordance with the study’s IRB packet.) Studies must use simulated participation or other data-based method of estimating participation duration AND must assess and adjust based on actual completion times after 10-25 real participants. Studies must be set to Inactive by the researcher when not presently collecting data through SONA, including breaks between semesters. If credit is assigned or adjusted manually, this must be done no more than one week after participation. Researchers must notify the SONA director of instances of participant misconduct and any appeals participants make. Online studies must link participation to a code number, not respondents’ real names, unless they have IRB permission to link data and real names. If emails or other identifying information are collected, this should be done in a separate survey, unlinked to the primary one.\nRegulations for Undergraduate Researchers\nUndergraduate students’s studies are restricted in the total number of SONA credits they can distribute through SONA. The cap is calculated by multiplying the total number of PSYC 101 students by 8 and then by 0.33. This is divided by the total number of undergraduates doing senior project that semester. No matter what, the cap will not be set greater than 100. You won’t know a semester’s cap until the semester begins, but it will be higher in the Fall and lower in the Spring.\nThis is a cap on the total number of credits undergraduate researchers can distribute, not the total number of participants. However, the bonus credit given by live studies does not count against this total. So, if the cap were set at 60, an online study requiring 25 minutes and worth 2 credits could include 30 participants. A live study lasting 25 minutes would be worth 3 credits (2 regular + 1 bonus), but could still recruit 30 participants, because only the regular credits count toward the cap.\nIf an undergraduate study makes an error, any credits distributed as a result still count against the resesarcher’s total, even if no useful data was generated.\nIf an undergraduate researcher wants to exceed the credit cap, they must apply for a waiver. To do so, they must submit their request to the department chair and the SONA director. Waivers will be judged based on the following criteria:\nA completed power analysis justifying the need Appropriate efforts to get the most power out of participants (i.e., recruitment plan, time estimate, reliable measures, modest number of conditions, etc.) A well-defined data analysis plan with a modest number of tests Specific, realistic plan to disseminate beyond RIT\nRecommendations for Researchers\nResearchers who have the flexibility to do so should consider collecting data in the Fall when there are more participants and fewer studies.\nPsychology faculty should consider offering extra credit for SONA participation in breadth and pre-track courses, especially when taught live and/or in the Spring.\nGraduate students who intend to use &gt;100 SONA credits should work with their faculty advisor to conduct a power analysis and adjust their plan accordingly.\nAll researchers should plan to avoid oversampling majority controls. If a researcher wants to recruit equal numbers of a majority and a minority group, the following procedure is advised: (1) Initially recruit members of both groups. (2) Monitor participation rates. (3) When the target number of majority participants is met, alter your exclusion criteria on SONA to indicate that only minority participants are eligible.\nAll researchers conducting online studies should use attention checks to and other techniques to ensure that credit only goes to valid, attentive participation. The IRB has ruled that credit may be denied or rescinded if a participant fails multiple unambiguous attention checks. A guide to creating and implementing attention checks is available for RIT researchers. Contact the SONA director to receive a copy.\nGetting More out of Fewer Participants\nWhen undergrads are asked how to improve a study, they nearly always suggest increasing sample size. While that does have benefits, it’s hardly the only way to strengthen a study’s power and validity, and it’s often not the best one. The suggestions below were written for undergraduate researchers, but apply to all studies.\nPlan analyses before you begin gathering data. This helps you avoid administering redundant tests, collecting responses you can’t score, and getting stuck with overly complicated statistical analyses.\nSelect a reasonable number of hypotheses and tests. More participants increases your power (your chance of finding real effects), but that power has to be divided among all the tests you run. Using the Bonferroni correction is a good way to keep this in mind and restrain yourself. A good undergraduate study has 2-6 preliminary tests (demographic differences, etc.), 3-8 tests of the main hypotheses, and 0-4 post-hoc tests.\nUse more reliable measures. Review survey psychometrics before selecting them. Avoid self-made surveys and single-item ratings.\nStudy fewer conditions, groups, etc. This raises your power.\nBe careful in your recruitment. Don’t recruit many unsuitable participants in hopes of getting a few target ones.\nRemember that undergraduate research does not have to be comprehensive! A rigorous investigation into one or two focused questions is better than a scattershot approach to many poorly-defined ones."

    "text": "The majority of content on this site is authored by Dr. Alan Smerbeck\n\n\nOverview\nPsychology is a science that relies on data and experimentation. Research determines which theories are well-supported and which should be discarded. Understanding psychology research is important to understanding psychology, which is why all PSYC 101 classes have the research experience requirement.\nSONA Systems is the system that we use at RIT (as do many other universities) to organize all research looking for student participation. This is a central location for you to identify the available studies, participate in them, receive course credit (and some studies may even offer payment).\nPlease use this website to navigate through the SONA system as either a student participant, researcher or instructor. Reach out to the SONA coordinator if you have any questions (sona.\n\n\nGeneral\n\nSections based on your role\n\n\n\nInfo\nThis requirement is pass/fail. If you have 8 credits of research experience by 5pm on the last day of classes, you pass. If you have fewer than 8 credits at that time, your course grade will be marked down the equivalent of one ‘step’ in the plus / minus system (i.e., B+ to B; B- to C+; D to F). This is managed through a system called SONA, which is why participation credits are often called SONA credits. 1 SONA credit is assigned per 15 minutes of participation, so 8 credits require a total of 2 hours’ time.\nFace-to-face studies in which you come in to the lab to do a task require a little more effort than completing surveys on your computer, and they also give you more insight into psychological research. As such, face-to-face studies offer a bonus SONA credit on top of the regular rate. So, a 30-minute online study would award 2 credits, while a 30-minute face-to-face study would award 3. You can tell which ones are face-to-face because they don’t say Online Study in the description.\nYou can earn credits in two ways: You can participate in real research studies OR you can complete research alternatives. You can identify research alternatives because they say Research Alternative next to them in the SONA listing. Research alternatives simulate real studies but do not collect data for analysis. If you can participate in real research, you are encouraged to do so, but participation is voluntary. Research alternatives are provided for students who cannot or choose not to participate in research.\nIf you are under 18, you cannot participate in most research studies because you cannot consent for yourself. You can complete research alternatives without parental consent. However, research alternatives are not available to all students until the last two weeks of class. Minor students (those aged 17 or under) can follow a special procedure to have early access to research alternatives, detailed HERE. This procedure is not required; minor students can still wait until the last two weeks of the semester to complete research alternatives.\nWhether you complete real research or alternatives, you must sign up through http://rit.sona-systems.com to get credit."

It should state in general terms what participants will be asked to do (e.g., take surveys, complete math problems, etc.) and the broad themes or topics (e.g., surveys about your mood and eating habits). This is NOT the same as the abstract you submitted to the IRB or the abstract you would use in a published paper. In most cases you will not reveal your exact hypotheses unless required by the IRB.\nDetailed Description – Participants only see this if they have clicked on the study. Many do not actually read it. If you really need people to read it, you are strongly urged to put, “PLEASE READ THE DETAILED DESCRIPTION BEFORE SIGNING UP” in all caps in the Brief Abstract.\nEligibility Requirements – Do NOT list age as an eligibility requirement; you should have already used the prescreen to ensure participants are 18+. If you have other eligibility requirements that can be managed using the prescreen, please use the prescreen and do not list them here. If you have eligibility requirements other than those covered by the prescreen, please list them here. Note that all Sona users are RIT students, so you can assume they are enrolled in college and able to read English.\nBe aware that sometimes participants sign up for studies without reading the eligibility criteria very carefully. You are strongly encouraged to reiterate your criteria with a few items at the start of your survey to ensure that only eligible people participate.\nDuration – You are required to test-run your study to get the best estimate of duration. Survey questions go much faster than you think, especially because respondents generally don’t spend a lot of time pondering them. Qualtrics’ estimate of duration is incorrect! Do not rely on it!\nCredits – Give a whole number value according to the following table, adding +1 for live studies:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 – 15 minutes\n1 credit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16 – 30 minutes\n2 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n31 – 45 minutes\n3 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n46 – 60 minutes\n4 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n61 – 75 minutes\n5 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n76 – 90 minutes\n6 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n91 – 105 minutes\n7 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n106 – 120 minutes\n8 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable credits should be used ONLY when participants will be completing different task sets; for example, if all participants will complete a 10 minute screener (1 credit) and some will go on to complete a 30 minute survey (40 minutes total, or 3 credits). The simple fact that some participants will take longer or shorter time to complete the same basic task does NOT mean you should use of variable credits.\nIf you find that average participation is taking considerably longer or shorter than your initial, you should considering changing the credit offering for future participants in the same study, but should give the number of credits promised to the current participants.\nPreparation – (rare) This line refers to actions participants must take (or not take) prior to the study and is usually left blank. An examples of a requirement that might go in this space would be, “Must not eat any solid food for 60 minutes prior your scheduled start time.”\nResearcher – You will be selected automatically. Add your faculty mentor and any other collaborators.\nIRB Approval Code – Our IRB (HSRO) does not provide approval codes per se. Instead, enter the date listed on your IRB decision form (Form C) in MMDDYYYY format.\nNext is a line that says Approved? which is handled by the SONA director.\nActive Study – If you want your study to be visible as soon as it’s approved, select yes. If you want your study to start out hidden, select no. Reasons to select no would include wanting to wait until a specific part of the semester to collect data. Once you have finished collecting your data, please set your study to inactive by selecting No. You can change this setting whenever you like, without needing SONA director approval. PSYC 101 students get frustrated when they try to find studies with available time slots. Setting your completed study to inactive clears it from the available study list, making it easier for PSYC 101 students to find active research.\n\n\n\nMost of these should be left in the default position. If an option is marked (rare), it should be left alone unless your study specifically requires it. That said, virtually every study will use at least some advanced settings. A few apply to many studies and are marked (common).\nPrerequisites (rare) – Use if people must be in a previous study before they can be in yours. Note that this does not automatically link their Study A responses to their Study B responses – you have to do that yourself.\nDisqualifiers (rare) – This disqualifies participants based on other studies they’ve enrolled in. It’s mainly used if people cannot be in two similar studies or two forms of the same study.\nCourse Restrictions (rare) – Use if you only want participants from specific courses or sections. Most participants are in PSYC101. Some are in other psychology classes that allow participation for extra credit.\nInvitation Code (rare) – Use if you’re going to give out personal invitations to specific people as a means of carefully screening participants.\nThe next few options are important for online studies.\nShould survey participants be identified only by a random, unique ID code? (common for online) – This defaults to ‘No’ which means that participant names will be used rather than numerical codes. The names or codes appear in two places. First, they’re listed in timeslot sign ups. Second, if you set up Qualtrics and SONA to automatically grant credit, the name or code will be in your data output file. In most cases, you should switch this option to ‘Yes’, meaning that anonymous codes will be used in place of names. Automatic credit assignment will work either way, and the use of code numbers increases participant privacy. If you have told the IRB that you will not be collecting participants’ names, you must select ‘Yes’.\nStudy URL (common for online) – If you’re using a survey instrument like Qualtrics, enter the URL here. If you’re going to automatically assign credit (highly recommended), enter the URL from Qualtrics and add this text at the end:\n?id=%SURVEY_CODE%\n\nSo, https://rit.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_b9ZD41hMdsaqE becomes\n\nhttps://rit.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_b9ZD41hMdsaqE**?id=%SURVEY_CODE%**\nIf you are using Qualtrics, you should set it up to grant credit automatically to those who complete the study. A brief version of the directions is provided below. (Detailed version HERE.)\n\nMake sure you put ?id=%SURVEY_CODE% at the end of your survey URL when you set it up in SONA.\nOnce you’ve finished adjusting the Advanced Settings and you’ve hit Add This Study, you’ll be taken to the Study Information page. Scroll down to the row labeled Website. You should see the words Qualtrics Redirect to a URL above a grey box with a web address in it. Hold onto this. You’ll need it in a moment.\nSwitch over to Qualtrics. While in your survey in Qualtrics, look at the top of the page, below the Qualtrics four-circle logo and the word Survey, to see Survey Flow. Click on that and a window will open up. In that window, select Add a New Element Here followed by Embedded Data. A green box with a dropdown menu will appear. Type ‘id’ (two letters, lowercase, no punctuation, nothing else) and hit enter. This green box can be anywhere in the order of your survey. Hit OK to close Survey Flow.\nNext to Survey Flow is a link labeled Survey Options. Click it and scroll down until you see the Survey Termination options. Select Redirect to a Full URL and paste the URL from the grey box in SONA under Qualtrics Redirect to a URL from step two.\nOnce you’ve saved all your changes in Qualtrics, go back to SONA and again find the box labeled Website under Study Information. There should be an orange box labeled Sample Link with Embedded ID Code. Click on it and you should be taken to the first page of your study, like a participant. Take your entire study and if everything is working properly, at the end, you should be automatically redirected back to SONA. If it works, it will say, System Message: No credit given, because you are not a participant, and therefore cannot sign up for this study. That means you have successfully set up your study to automatically grant credit.\n\nYour study should begin with a consent form that kicks people out if they do not consent. Do not simply redirect them to the end of the study. That will cause them to receive Sona credit for not participating. Instead, in Survey Flow, branch to the End of Survey. In the End of Survey block, click Customize, then Override Survey Options and Redirect to a URL. Set it to redirect to www.rit.edu.\nIf your study has a choice between receiving Sona credit or participating in a raffle, you must ensure that no participant receives both Sona credit and a raffle entry. To do this, at the end of the study, put a forced-choice multiple choice question asking whether the participant would like Sona credit or a raffle entry. The Sona credit option should redirect back to the Qualtrics Redirect to a URL web address you obtained from Sona. The raffle entry option should redirect participants to a separate Qualtrics survey that collects raffle information.\nStudy URL Display (rare) – Toggles whether participants can see the actual study URL, even after finishing; defaults to ‘no’. This prevents participants from re-entering the survey and causing problems. Only switch to ‘yes’ if they are going to be required to re-enter for some reason.\nThis next few options are important for live studies.\nParticipant Sign Up Deadline (common for live) – For live studies, this prevents participants from signing up right before a timeslot. It defaults to 24 hours, meaning they must give you at least 1 day’s notice to participate. You can make this longer or shorter according to your needs. Online studies should ignore this.\nParticipant Cancellation Deadline(common for live) – Live study participants will be told that they must cancel at least this many hours before their scheduled time. If they cancel at least that far in advance, you should assign them an excused absence. If they cancel after the cancellation deadline, the absence can be considered unexcused. Online studies should ignore this.\nShould the Researcher receive an email notification when a participant signs up or cancels? (common for live) – This is very useful for researchers conducting live studies to keep track of signups and cancellations. Live study researchers should consider selecting ‘yes’. Online studies should ignore this.\nResearchers at Timeslot-Level (common for live) – This is generally used in larger studies with one lead investigator and many research assistants. It means that different researchers or research assistants can open their own set of available timeslots that they manage individually.\nThe final two options apply to both live and online studies, but are both very rare.\nComments Section (rare) – Use this if you want to explain to the administrator why an unusual choice was made.\nResearch Alternative (rare) – Only the system administrator can change this. It toggles to yes when SONA credit is offered for a task that is not research, such as aiding in practice test administration or gathering data for a class exercise. If you have made arrangements with the SONA administrator to offer a research alternative, email the administrator a reminder of this when you request that your study be approved.\nOnce you have made your selections for all of the above, click Add This Study to move forward.\n\n\n\nAfter clicking Add This Study, You will be brought to a Study Information page. Check that everything is correct. Under Study Status, you will have an option to Send Request for approval of your study. Be sure to hit this button so that your study can be approved by the SONA administrator.\nYou must also email the SONA administrator directly with basic information about your study (your name, your study’s name), and your plans to comply with our SONA regulations.\nYou will see an option to set Prescreen Restrictions. If you have not yet set your prescreen restrictions, do so now. Remember, you must use the prescreen for age. You may use the prescreen for hearing status, ability to understand oral English, colorblindness, or visual acuity.\n\n\n\nThis occurs after your study is approved by the SONA administrator and set to Active. Participants cannot sign up until you create timeslots. Go to Study Menu, then View / Administer Timeslots. If you are creating a live study, you should make lots of little time slots for all the possible times you can test subjects, usually with a maximum of one participant per timeslot.\nIf you are creating an online study, you should create a single large timeslot. I recommend the timeslot be one week in duration. During the first week, this timeslot should have a maximum number of participants equal to the maximum number of participants you intend to recruit, according to your research plan and department regulations.\nAt the end of that week, create a new timeslot, with a maximum number of participants equal to the total number you need minus the number you’ve already recruited.\nIf you are recruiting a control group (majority) and a target group (less common trait), begin by accepting all participants. Once you have the total number of majority participants you need, change your eligibility criteria so you are only recruiting target group participants. So, if you want 30 Deaf and 30 Hearing, you would begin by accepting all participants. Then, when you have 30 Hearing participants, you would change your eligibility criteria to permit only Deaf participants.\n\n\n\nEnter SONA as a researcher, go to My Studies, and click on Timeslots at the right side of the row. Click on any individual time slot to address it. Each row will be labeled by an ID code or name. You will be able to choose between Participated (and selecting the number of credits), Unexcused No-Show, Excused No-Show, and No Action Taken. Timeslots begin at No Action Taken.\nIf you’re doing an online study and you’ve set it up to automatically grant credit, completers should receive full credit a few minutes after finishing the study. You won’t need to do anything.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nLive study\nOnline study\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticipated (full credit)\nNormal participation, give as soon as possible\nNormal participation, should be assigned automatically\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticipated (partial credit)\nGenerally not given unless you have made arrangements with the IRB\nGenerally not given unless you have made arrangements with the IRB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnexcused No-Show\nParticipant did not arrive at appointment AND made no attempt to contact researcher\nAttempted or “completed” the study by cheating or failing multiple attention checks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExcused No-Show\nParticipant did not arrive at appointment but notified researcher\nParticipant signed up for timeslot but never attempted or completed the study\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo Action Taken Default\nDefault; switch after appointment\nDefault; switch once timeslot ends\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn most cases, participants will receive full credit or an excused no-show. You may add a clause in your consent form indicating that partial credit will be granted to participants who begin but do not complete the study. If the IRB approves your consent form with this clause in it, you may grant pro-rated partial credit to those who began but did not complete the study. Otherwise, those who start but do not finish are considered excused no-shows.\nUnexcused no-shows should be reported to the SONA administrator. Provide the participant’s name or code number, the study, and the reason for denying credit.\nIf you are conducting a live study, you will have to manually grant credit. You are encouraged to do this often, typically the same day as testing. Participants will expect their credit to be processed within 1 week at the absolute latest. In the rare event you are conducting an online survey study but assigning credit manually, please do so minimally at least once per week, and ideally more often.\n\n\n\nYou can close your study whenever you have sufficient participants or reach other stop point, but no matter what, SONA participation always ends at 5pm on the last day of classes. Please be sure that you do not have any timeslots available extending past this date. Please process any outstanding timeslots as quickly as possible after classes end, within 48 hours at the most.\nIf you have not already done so, set your study to Inactive by going to the Study Information screen, under the Active Study question, and selecting No. If your study is not finished, you can return it to active status when you resume data collection through SONA. You will not need administrator approval to do so."

Go to Study Menu, then View / Administer Timeslots. If you are creating a live study, you should make lots of little time slots for all the possible times you can test subjects, usually with a maximum of one participant per timeslot.\nIf you are creating an online study, you should create a single large timeslot. I recommend the timeslot be one week in duration. During the first week, this timeslot should have a maximum number of participants equal to the maximum number of participants you intend to recruit, according to your research plan and department regulations.\nAt the end of that week, create a new timeslot, with a maximum number of participants equal to the total number you need minus the number you’ve already recruited.\nIf you are recruiting a control group (majority) and a target group (less common trait), begin by accepting all participants. Once you have the total number of majority participants you need, change your eligibility criteria so you are only recruiting target group participants. So, if you want 30 Deaf and 30 Hearing, you would begin by accepting all participants. Then, when you have 30 Hearing participants, you would change your eligibility criteria to permit only Deaf participants."

    "text": "Statement in Syllabus\nFor courses that will be requiring students to participate in research studies through SONA, please be sure to include the following information into your syllabus (please copy & paste):\nResearch Participation (SONA):\nTo help students learn more about research in psychology, all PSYC 101 classes require students to complete 8 credits worth of participation in research or research alternatives. All of our research is conducted through an online platform called Sona, so research participation credits are called Sona credits.\nSona credits must be completed by 5pm on the last day of classes. If you have fewer than 8 credits by that time, your grade will be lowered by one “step” (i.e., from B+ to B, from C- to D, from D to F). Each study lists how many credits it offers at a rate of 1 credit per 15 minutes of participation, and a 1 credit bonus for in-person studies.\nPlease visit https://ritpsych.github.io/sona/ for more information on how to make an account and complete the research participation requirement.\n\n\nPSYC 101 Instructors\nAll PSYC 101 classes require students to complete 8 credits worth of participation in research or research alternatives. Students who earn 8 credits should receive the expected grade given their other course performance. If a student who earns fewer than 8 credits, that student’s grade should be lowered by one “step” (i.e., from B+ to B, from C- to D, from D to F). This requirement is pass/fail. There is no partial credit for a student who earns 7 or fewer credits, earns credits after the deadline, or has some other excuse for not participating.\nIf your students tell you that no studies are available, they are not eligible for any studies or for some other reason cannot participate, tell them to check back later - studies change over the course of the semester. If they try to tell you that there were never sufficient studies available, they are mistaken or lying. We have never had a student whose disabilities or other conditions excluded them from every possible study - if you think you might have found the exception, please contact the Sona director.\nAt the end of the semester, I will send you a report of your students’ credits. Your grades should be based on that report. Do not grant additional credits because students said they completed other studies, claim that credit was inappropriately denied, or that a researcher has not yet given them credit they earned. All of those issues are resolved before the report is sent.\nAll of our research / research alternative participation is managed by the Sona system (https://rit.sona-systems.com/). On the website, under the Participants heading, I have posted extensive information about how students can get a Sona account, enroll in studies, and earn credit. There is also an extended FAQ that covers less common questions. Your students should be able to manage most Sona participation without your assistance. If they have questions, tell them to review the guidance available on this site and, if that doesn’t work, to contact the Sona administrator directly (Dr. Dustin Haraden, dxhgsh@rit.edu).\nResearch on Sona is conducted by faculty, graduate students, and undergraduates. Some researchers have studies posted already. Our undergraduate senior project students typically begin posting their projects 2-4 weeks into the semester, so students shouldn’t worry if there are few options initially. Students should be especially encouraged to participate in live studies. Live studies give students more exposure to psychology research methodology and techniques. Students also receive a bonus credit for live studies, above the usual rate.\nAt the beginning of each semester, students will be asked to complete a 5-question prescreen which asks about age (under 18 or 18+), hearing, and vision. This is used to address the most common exclusionary criteria. Most studies have additional participant requirements - students must read the study description in Sona to ensure they are eligible. Each study has exclusion criteria. It is normal for students to be excluded from a few studies, but there are always enough credits available for ALL students to meet the 8-credit requirement.\nResearch alternatives will be made available in the last 2 weeks of the semester for students who cannot or refuse to participate in real research. These fake studies are similar to real research participation and are clearly marked as ‘research alternatives’. All take 20 – 30 minutes to complete online and offer 2 Sona credits, automatically awarded on completion. Other research alternatives may be posted earlier in the semester as well. Students are, of course, encouraged to participate in real research if they are able and willing to do so.\nStudents who indicate they are under 18 in the prescreen will be able to access the research alternatives immediately but will not be allowed to access any other studies. There is no way to change prescreen status during the semester, so a student who turns 18 during the semester has two choices: Complete the prescreen immediately and only do research alternatives OR begin research participation after their birthday and have normal access to studies. Any student who lies about their age on the prescreen will lose ALL credits for the whole semester and will be prohibited from earning more.\nParticipation for the semester ends at 5pm on the last day of classes. Please remind your students of the deadline.\nOnce the participation period ends, the Sona director will process the data. This requires me to contact researchers to resolve any unprocessed credits and may take 1-3 days. As soon as the report is available, I will send it to you. You will receive it early in finals week, well before grades are due. (Please do not email me and ask for it before then - I cannot process the data any faster.) The email will list all students who enrolled in your class on Sona and the number of credits they earned. It is the students’ job to enroll themselves in the correct class, and if they don’t do so, they usually fix the mistake before the semester’s end. However, if your email report contains names not in your class, please let me know.\n\n\nPSYC 200+ Instructors\nWhile Sona registries for PSYC 101 classes are created by default, anyone at the 200+ level choosing to offer extra credit must need to contact the Sona director at the beginning of the semester to have a section created for their class.\nFirst, if you do not already have a Sona instructor account, please email the Sona director so one can be created for you. You should only have one Sona account. If you already have a participant or researcher account, tell the director to add instructor status to your existing account.\nOnce you have instructor access, email the Sona director the following information:\n\nThe days and times of the class (or “Online”)\nThe 3-digit class number (i.e., PSYC 249)\nThe 5-digit unique course code\n\nI will email you a PDF document that you should share with your students."
