Lab assignments are to be done using R and RMarkdown; completed assignments should be submitted through myCourses, and students must attach both the .Rmd file and the compiled HTML file.\nLab assignments are due at the beginning of class on the day the assignment is listed. Lab assignments may be resubmitted with corrections and receive full credit. Please note, however, that corrections can only be made to problems that were answered at initial submission. To be considered for re-submission, assignments will have to be corrected and returned through myCourses within a week of receiving the initial grade. There is no limit to the number of times a homework assignment may be resubmitted as long as it is within the time frame.\nLate assignments will be subject to the [late policy] with 25% being deducted for being late, and an additional 5% for each 24h period after the due date. For example, if you correctly answer questions totaling 28 points and turn it in 6 hours late, the assignment will receive 21 points. If you resubmit this assignment with corrected answers (a total of 30 points), the assignment will receive 22.5 points. Late assignments will be accepted only within 7 days of the original deadline.\nYou may discuss assignments with your classmates; however, it is important that you complete each assignment on your own and do not simply copy someone else‚Äôs code. If I believe one student has copied another‚Äôs work, both students will receive a 0 on the homework assignment and will not be allowed to resubmit the assignment for points.",

This can also include anything related to your personal life or mental health that you would like for me to know, such as whether you are struggling to balance classes and research, having trouble creating a workspace at home, or whether you can balance time spent on campus and off. This can also be completely random things, like a news article you can‚Äôt stop thinking about, or a favorite TV show, movie or book that you just love (especially if it is LOTR or Cosmere related). The content of what you write has no impact on your grade. In addition, what you write will be kept confidential.\nYou may skip up to 5 journal entries with no penalty. This means that the total amount of journal entries you must submit is at least 10.\nThe purpose of this assignment is to help facilitate communication between you and me. I have found other instructors using this and I would like to be able to develop supportive relationships with students, so I decided to implement this. Other instructors reported that they found that many students were more comfortable discussing questions and concerns in their journal assignments rather than through email.",

Ultimately, a document will be compiled with all of the information that is presented in order for students to take with them moving forward.\nThe main focus of the presentations will be reflective of the structure of the course: (1) Practical and Using R; and (2) In-depth Stats. For topic 1, students will be asked to present on a package/library in R that they have found and walk through the usefulness of that tool. Then for topic 2, you will provide an overview of a specific statistical test/concept, this test being used in a paper and how it is written up.
